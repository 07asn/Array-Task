## 📄 Questions

### Q1: Display Fruits with Images
In this question, an array of fruits is given, where each fruit contains a name and an image URL. JavaScript is used to dynamically create an ordered list (`<ol>`) in HTML and populate it with list items (`<li>`) that display the name and image of each fruit.

### Q2: Find Number in Array
In this task, a function is created to find a specified number in an array. The function loops through the array and returns the index of the number if found, or -1 if the number doesn't exist.
